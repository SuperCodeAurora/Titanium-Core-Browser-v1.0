## 🚀 Core Philosophy

1. **No Artificial Intelligence:** There are no chatbots, no smart summaries, and no API keys required. It parses HTML/CSS/JS and renders it. That is all.
2. **Micro-Footprint:** Built to consume the absolute minimum amount of RAM necessary to keep your tabs alive.
3. **Unbreakable Core:** Designed to be a rock-solid daily driver that doesn't crash when loading heavy DOM elements.
